[Crafty](http://craftyjs.com) API document is kind of light. The examples are just snippets which are not runnable. I created some stand-alone examples, so that uses can run any of them without the need to add additional code. Note that this is project in progress. Examples of only a small number of functions in Crafty have been created.
